This repository is a awesome starting point for Beginners and Interessted which wanna develope fast Crossplattform Desktop Applications based on 
Node.js and Javascript. There are no Electron Experiences required but you should be familiar with Javascript and have Node already running on your system.
To keep things simple i will stick for these apps with ECMAScript 2015 or better known as ES6.
TypeScript is aweseome! Its a superset of Javascript and brings more value for you as developer. To make it not more complicated for you we stick with
ECMAScript 2015 for those apps.

If you find some code which looks new too you google yourself to the asweres and try to get familiar with the new syntax.
There are lots of good resources about ECMAScript and Node here on Github, few of them i wrote even myself.
Further i forked some usefull Tutorials, Starter Apps and Example Code in my Repository.
You can have a look around, maybe you find some usefull information for you ...

For this project i setup the basic tooling for you but feel free to make changes to your needs `.eslintrc.json`
I also will not optimize the code for deployment or minimize things. But i think at the end of this course i will provide you with those informations and create a nice setup.
But for your next basic apps we don't wanna deploy them and keep it simple and easy ...

Lets get started by cloning this repository to your local disc via `git clone https://github.com/ellerbrock/electron-from-0-to-hero.git`.

In chapter 01 you will learn how to install the dependencies for our application and run your first Electron App inside the Browser. 
Even no functionality and poorly looking you already got the V8 power inside the browser which is awesome!

Have some fun with your first Electron experiences!

Over the next days i will try to add more functionality and commit here the updates ...
